# 🎨 Introduction to CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

## 📌 Why CSS Was Introduced

- HTML handles the **structure** and **meaning** of content.
- CSS controls how that content **looks and feels** — layout, colors, fonts, spacing, animations, etc.
- Without CSS, every website would look like plain black text on a white background.

> ✅ In simple words:  
> **HTML = content (what you say)**  
> **CSS = style (how you say it)**

---

## 🎯 What CSS Really Does

> 💡 The **main goal of CSS** is to make websites **visually appealing**.

It allows us to:

- Change colors, font sizes, margins, padding
- Make layouts responsive
- Animate elements
- Control position, display, and visibility

---

## 🧠 The Core Concept of CSS

> CSS is all about **selecting elements** and then **styling them**.

### 🔹 Example:

```css
p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 18px;
}
```

- This selects all `<p>` elements and styles them with blue text and larger font size.

## 🧩 Ways to Apply CSS in HTML

You can write CSS in **three ways**, each with its own use case and priority:

### 1️⃣ Inline CSS

Written directly inside the tag using the `style` attribute.

```html
<p style="color: red;">This is red text.</p>
```

✅ Good for quick tests  
❌ Not reusable, hard to maintain

---

### 2️⃣ Internal CSS

Written inside a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` of the HTML file.

```html
<head>
  <style>
    p {
      color: green;
    }
  </style>
</head>
```

✅ Useful for small projects or single-page styling  
❌ Still not reusable across multiple files

---

### 3️⃣ External CSS

Written in a separate `.css` file and linked to the HTML using `<link>`.

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css" />
</head>
```

✅ Best for large projects — clean, reusable, maintainable  
✅ Keeps HTML and CSS separate

---

## 📊 CSS Priority Order (Specificity)

If all three methods are used for the same element, this is the order of priority:

```
Inline CSS > Internal CSS > External CSS
```

> Always try to **avoid inline CSS** in real projects for better scalability.

## 🆔 ID and 🎯 Class: The Tag Targeting System

To apply styles **to specific elements**, we use **classes and IDs**.

---

### 🧠 Analogy to Understand:

- Think of your HTML page as a **classroom**.
- Every student can wear the **same uniform** (that's a `class`).
- But each student has a **roll number** (that's an `id` — unique).

---

### 🔹 Class (Reusable)

- A class can be shared by **multiple elements**.
- Defined using `class="name"` in HTML
- Selected in CSS with a dot (`.`)

```html
<p class="highlight">This is highlighted text.</p>
```

```css
.highlight {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

---

### 🔹 ID (Unique)

- An ID should be used by **only one element** on a page.
- Defined using `id="name"` in HTML
- Selected in CSS with a hash (`#`)

```html
<p id="main-heading">Welcome</p>
```

```css
#main-heading {
  font-size: 32px;
}
```

---

### 🎯 Summary: Class vs ID

| Feature      | Class (`.`)                  | ID (`#`)                   |
| ------------ | ---------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Reusability  | Can be used on many elements | Only once per page         |
| CSS Selector | `.` (dot)                    | `#` (hash)                 |
| Specificity  | Lower                        | Higher                     |
| Use Case     | Styling groups of elements   | Targeting a unique element |
